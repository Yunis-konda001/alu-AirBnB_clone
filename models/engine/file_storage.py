#Write a class FileStorage that serializes instances to a JSON file and deserializes JSON file to instances
#it will have this Private class attributes:
# __file_path: string - path to the JSON file (ex: file.json)
# __objects: dictionary - empty but will store all objects by <class name>.id (ex: to store a BaseModel object with id=12121212, the key will be BaseModel.12121212)    
# Public instance methods:
# all(self): returns the dictionary __objects
# new(self, obj): sets in __objects the obj with key <obj class name>.id
# save(self): serializes __objects to the JSON file (path: __file_path)
# reload(self): deserializes the JSON file to __objects (only if the JSON file (__file_path) exists ; otherwise, do nothing. If the file doesnâ€™t exist, no exception should be raised)
